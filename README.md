This is a fun and interactive way to play Rock, Paper, Scissors game in the browser.
The page asks, "Do you wanna play Rock Paper Scissors?" If the user clicks "Yes", they are asked to enter their username and Email.
If the user clicks "No" windows closes after showing goodbye message. 
After the user enters their user details, game starts and the user picks rock, paper or scissors.
The computer randomly chooses one as well. If the user wins, confetti animation appears. 
User can restart the game if he clicks the play again link which resets and restarts the game.

**What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?**
could have added more event delegation on a parent element instead of adding more event handlers on the element itself. 

**Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?**
AMaking the page look the same at every stage of the game with CSS took longer than expected. 
Next time, I would style the page as I build the game instead of doing it all at the end.

**What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?**
Keeping track of the wins, losses and ties would be a feature that I would have added if I had more time.
